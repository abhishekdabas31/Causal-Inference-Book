# Structural Causal Model

**Definition**: The structural Causal Model tries to represent the data generating process\(DGP\) by explicitly defining causal relationships.

**Note**: With the Structural Causal Model, which helps to unbox the real-world black-box model. Helps us in Interpretability. 

The Structural Causal Model tries to formalize the causal relationships in the form of a graph. Then using some of the defined algorithms we can determine whether the effect can be calculated through the data available or not. **These tools are as good as the assumptions feed to the system.** 

The SCM helps us in identifying the testable implications from the causal graph which can be used to come to causal conclusions. These testable functions could be really easy such as Linear functions, or as complex as cubic functions.

**Causal Hierarchy:**

Most of the data we have is observational data, and we want to use those observations to answer the questions about interventions.
