# Structural Causal Model

Definition:



The Structural Causal Model tries to formalize the causal relationships in the form of a graph. Then using some of the defined algorithms we can determine whether the effect can be calculated through the data available or not. **These tools are as good as the assumptions feed to the system.** 

**Causal Hierarchy:**

Most of the data we have is observational data, and we want to use those observations to answer the questions about interventions.
