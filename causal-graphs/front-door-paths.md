# Front Door Paths

**Front door Path:** Arrows moving away from the treatment are called Front Door Paths. We do not want to block the front door paths when figuring out the causal relationships as it captures the effects we are interested in. They are part of the effect of the treatment.  Example:

A -&gt; B or A -&gt; C-&gt; B , both of these are front door paths
