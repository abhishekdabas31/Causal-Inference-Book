# Origin of Causality

Statisticians have been considering and researching on causality for a very long time. Statisticians started working on causality in 1920. Causality has been recognized as another area of research since the 1970s. Causality has done immense progress in past 30 years!!

**Mainly there are 2 Frameworks :**

1. **Rubin Causal Model \(RCM\) by Rubin-Neyman -** Potential Outcomes Framework ****Control Group Experiments
2. **Structural Causal Model \(SCM\) by Judea Perl** - Causal Graphical Models, Causal Diagrams and Do-Calculus

Both of these frameworks have different usage and overall focus on the same concept.  

Potential Outcome Framework has been really popular amongst statisticians. Donald Rubin has done a lot of work in developing the Potential Outcomes Framework. This started with more of a statistical approach earlier. Later, Judea Perl started working on formalizing a new world of causal Inference. Judea Perl has contributed a lot in developing the field of Causal Inference and stating its importance in the field of AI.

There has been a Causal revolution - from statistics to counterfactual !!

In recent years the field of causal inference has grown in scope and impact. Today, it's not only Judea Perl, but also researchers of MIT, and various other universities that agree on the need of causal models for human-like intelligence in machines [link](http://www.mit.edu/~tomeru/papers/machines_that_think.pdf)

Causal Inference is now making its way into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as people are increasingly talking about this significant research area.[ Yoshua Benjio statement. ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/17/66372/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/)
