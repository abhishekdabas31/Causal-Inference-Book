# Preface

Our introduction towards the topic of Causal inference and causal reasoning came from a class the both of us took took together in the Summer of 2020. The class was based around working on various research topics rotating around the overall idea of Computational Skepticism.

The both of us decided to focus on the research topic of Causal Inference. We had initially thought that we would be able bring up something novel in the field and started working with that goal in our heads. However, as we kept going through our literature survey we realised we had a massive task on our hands. Most of the literature on Causal Inference is so incredibly diverse and spread out into so many different fields that it was taking us a really long time to even grasp some of the basic concepts of Causal inference as a whole.

This is when we decided to switch paths. We decided that before we go about building something novel in the area of Causal Inference we had to compile all our learnings into one place so that it is much easier for us to refer back to in the future, as well we would be able to help through this compilation other lone wanderers who decide to step into this vast forest of Causal Inference.

Initially, the both of us started documenting our understanding and experimentation in the world of Causal Inference in the form of medium articles and Google colab notebooks. Once we covered more ground, we started putting in all our findings and resources in the form of this book.

The goal of this book is to help anyone with the interest of exploring what causal inference is and bring them up to speed with what the current "State of The Art" is just through this one resource. We want to show how Causal Inference is not a different path towards Machine Learning but an important aspect of the same pipeline that involves statistical inferences.

The only pre-requisite one must have to be able completely grasp most of the concepts of the book is a good statistical background and an interest in understanding about causal inference.
