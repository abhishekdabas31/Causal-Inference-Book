# Correlation

 **“**A bunch of variables that vary together for a very long time, or vary cohesively is correlation**”- Judea Perl**

If the two variables are correlated or associated or statistically related with each other then, one of these causal relationships must be true:

1. A -&gt; B
2. A &lt;-B
3. A &lt;- C -&gt; B
4. Chance

As we see that there are multiple possibilities of causal relationships, so we cant rush to any one of the conclusions.

Joint distribution:

P\(A,B\) = P\(A\|B\)P\(B\) OR P\(B\|A\)P\(A\)
