# Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

Causal Inference has a missing data problem. We cannot observe both the potential outcomes, we only observe one. **This is also considered as a Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.** 

**Example:** In the case of a medical procedure, we can only observe when people are given medical treatment or not. We can never observe both.
