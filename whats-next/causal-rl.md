# Causal RL

Causal Reinforcement Learning = Causal Inference + Reinforcement Learning

It is process where the Causal Models tries to explicitly define the causal relationships of the environment in the real world, and RL is used for optimizing the policy based on this predefined causal Model. 

RL is mostly used in Gaming industry today, where the causal structure is pre-defined. Humans have built the game so we know the structure of the world we have built, hence we have the causal structure for this world. In the case of real-world, we do not have the causal structure\(at least to date\). When we implement this technique of Reinforcement learning to optimize the output by running multiple scenarios on the real-world causal structure, it could be really helpful.
