# CausalInference

The CausalInference package of Python allows us to generate the values of Adjustment Treatment Effect, Propensity Score, 
and also enable stratification and improving co-variate balance. 

Have a look at the co-lab notebook below to see how the CausalInference package can be used to determine the best Backdoor Adjustment path for 
a causal model.
