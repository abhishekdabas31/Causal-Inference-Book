# Other Libraries

## Some other libraries for performing Causal Analysis are:

1. [CausalImapct](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html) - It is a methodology developed by Google to estimate the causal impact of a treatment in the treated group. An R package for causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models.
2. [Causal Fusion](https://causalfusion.net/login) -  A library developed by [Professor Elias](https://causalai.net/), for data scientists to perform causal analysis, including model construction and testing, query identification and estimation, and, more broadly, causal inference and fusion. This application is in the **Beta version** currently, but is very powerful and contains almost all major tools to infer causality.
