# Tools and Libraries

For effective and faster implementation of Causal Inference on a larger scale, there are some libraries built and ready for implementation. Most of these libraries are for R and python. We will try to understand and explore how to implement some of these libraries. 

* Why do we need Libraries?

To understand and detect the causal relationship we have a lot of assumptions in our model, which we need to check. In such we have to repeat the common steps. Ensuring the validity of our assumptions and testing them is very essential.
