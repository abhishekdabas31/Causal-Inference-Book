# Tools and Libraries

For the effective and faster implementation of Causal Inference on a larger scale, there are some libraries built, which are ready for implementation. Most of these libraries are for R and Python. We will try to understand and explore how to implement some of these libraries for causal inference.

* **Why do we need Libraries for Causal Inference?**

To understand and detect the causal relationship we have a lot of assumptions in our model, which we need to check. In such a case, we have to repeat some very common steps. Ensuring the validity of our assumptions and testing them is very essential in causal inference. These Libraries help us with these repeated steps of testing and make it faster.
