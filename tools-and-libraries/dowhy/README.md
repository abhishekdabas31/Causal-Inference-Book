# DoWhy

**DoWhy is a Python Library for Causal Inference from Microsoft, developed by** Amit Sharma, Emre Kiciman. Its name is inspired by Judea Pearlâ€™s do-calculus for causal inference. 

**About**: DoWhy is a Python library for causal inference that supports explicit modeling and testing of causal assumptions. DoWhy is based on a unified language for causal inference, combining causal graphical models and potential outcomes frameworks.

DoWhy is a very effective and helpful library for **implementing Causal Inference**. The library implements causality by **first making the underlying assumptions explicit**, for example, by explicitly representing identified estimands. **Secondly by making sensitivity analysis and other robustness checks** on these explicit assumptions. The goal here is to enable people to focus their efforts on identifying assumptions for causal inference, rather than on details of estimation.
