We do not observe the counterfactuals in the real world. What we try to do is build a causal Structure, which can be used for answering the causal questions.

If we have the causal structure, the probabilistic equation of the model, then we can try to answer the counterfactual questions. We can do this from the observed data. 

The approach here is to build a robust structure for the environment and then we can use it for answering different types of questions.
