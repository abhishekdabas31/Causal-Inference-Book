# Potential Outcomes Framework

Potential Outcome Framework has helped in giving causal effects very precise definitions.

**Causal Effects in Potential Outcomes Framework :**

**Potential outcome** is the outcome that would be observed if an individual is given a specific value of the treatment. For every Individual one can not simultaneously observe the 2 potential Outcomes, we can only observe one. Here, the unobserved outcome is called the **"Counterfactual Outcome ".**

**Example:** What is the causal effect of doing a Master's degree and getting a high paying job?

* Treatment: doing Master's \(T=1\) & not doing Master's \(T=0\)
* Every individual person has 2 potential outcomes, Yt=0 & Yt=1 .

1. Yt=0 -&gt; Potential Outcome when not doing Masters
2. Yt=1 -&gt; Potential Outcome when doing Masters

**ITE:** Individual Treatment Effect is the difference between the 2 potential outcomes for a particular individual. We cannot measure ICE as we would need counterfactual value for the individual.

* ICE = Y1 - Y0

**ATE:** Average Treatment Effect is the average difference between the 2 potential outcomes averaged over the entire population of interest. It is the population level average of the Individual Causal Effect\(ICE\).

* ATE = E\[Yi1\] - E\[Yi0\]
* **Note**: Even though an Individual Causal Effect is non zero, the Average causal effect can be Zero.
