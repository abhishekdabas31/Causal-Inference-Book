# Modeling for Causal Inference


Causal Models are mathematical models representing a causal relationship within an individual system or population. They
allow for inferences to be drawn about the causal relationships from statistical data. These models allow us
to get a good understanding of the relationship between causation and probability. 








**NOTE :** _With these Methods, we can try to reduce the bias within our Model. It does not completely remove the bias._
