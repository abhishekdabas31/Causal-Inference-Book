# Problems with Randomization

1. Randomized trials are expensive
2. Sometimes randomized trials can be unethical. **Example**: We can not randomize the population of interest into people where they are forced to smoke for testing if there is a causal relationship from smoking to lung cancer.
3. Randomized trials consume a lot of time for testing and collecting results. Sometimes the results are needed urgently and waiting for the outcome is not an option. Following people for a longer duration of time can be hard.
4. It's hard to build the perfect environment for testing and controlling the environment. **Example**: testing medication on people and making sure the consumption of medication and all other things are controlled is hard.
