# Experimental Data

Experimental Studies are ones where we do a real intervention on the population and study the effect of that intervention. The population is divided into "Treatment" and "Control" group where one receives the treatment and other does not. Then the effect on the population is compared and studied to make causal Conclusions. It is considered a very powerful method to get causation.

**Fact**: Experiments and empirical observations have been the most important part of the [Scientific Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), which allows engineers and scientists to innovate by making some hypotheses, gathering data on them, and making a decision based on these hypotheses. Experimentation here plays a very important role in collecting data to test hypotheses and help in the decision-making process as part of scientific method.
