# Stratification

Stratification is defined as the act of sorting data, people, and objects into distinct groups or layers. It is a 
technique used in combination with other data analysis tools. When data from a variety of sources or categories have been 
lumped together, the meaning of the data can be difficult to see. This data collection and analysis technique separates 
the data so that patterns can be seen and is considered one of the seven basic quality tools.

From the definition it is clear to see that stratification is exactly what leads us to the [Simpson's Paradox](bias/simpsons-paradox.md).

When the whole population is bunched together and not stratified on a particular variable, our inference can be very different
that what it would be, had the stratification been performed.
