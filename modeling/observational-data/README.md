# Non-Experimental / Observational Data

Non-Experimental/Observational study are the ones where one observes the effect of the treatment in a group of people without trying to make any intervention or changes. The Population with elements that have the same characteristics are compared with respect to the exposure to make Causal Conclusions.

Randomization is not always possible\(unethical somethimes\), which is why most of the data is in the form of observational data. Making conclusions from Observational data is really hard. It is in fact one of the biggest problems in causality. 

**Note**: Experimental data is too expensive and also illegal sometimes, which is why we heavily depend on Observational data for the causal conclusions
