# Implications

**Adding visualization here showing stratification:**

Example: Comparing the Click-Through Rates\(CTR\) for A page and B page.

* **Analysis without stratification:**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2831%29.png)

A performs a little better than B

* \*\*Analysis on removal of over sampling for Old people in the data set. 

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

**B performs better than A**

* **Analysis when we stratify on one of the features\("Age"\):**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/old_stratified.png) ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/young_stratified.png)

We see that the performance of A and B depends on the age of the person and that is the reason we were getting flawed inferences earlier.
