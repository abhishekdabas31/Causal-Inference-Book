# Weighting

Weighing: It is a very common method that has been used for a long time now. When the sample we have is not the representation of the real world or the broader population, weighting can be used for the sample to look more like the population. To do this larger weights are added to the individuals who are underrepresented in the sample and a lower weight to those who are over-represented. 

"Assign a weight" to every individual in the strategy for this method.
