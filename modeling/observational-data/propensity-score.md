# Propensity Score

The Propensity Score method builds a logistic regression model that can predict the probability of a person being given the treatment. It is denoted by p\(x\)

$$
p(x)=P(T=1|X=x)
$$

**There are multiple sub-methods for Propensity scores:**

1. Propensity based stratification
2. Propensity score matching
3. Inverse Propensity Weighting
