# Guide to Causal Inference

**Causal Inference** is the process of drawing conclusions about a causal connection. The question that is asked most often for research in health, social, and behavioral science is about causal nature!

"In Addition, Everything that becomes or changes must do so owing to some cause. For Nothing can come to be without a cause."

-- [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) in [Timaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue))
