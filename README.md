# A Guide to Causal Inference

**Causal Inference** is the process of drawing conclusions about a causal connection. The question that is asked most often for research in health, social, and behavioral science is about the causal nature of things.

"_In Addition, Everything that becomes or changes must do so owing to some cause. For Nothing can come to be without a cause!!_" - [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) in Timaeus
