1. "I think we need to consider the hard challenges of AI and not be satisfied with short-term, incremental advances. I’m not saying I want to forget deep learning. On the contrary, I want to build on it. But we need to be able to extend it to do things like reasoning, **learning causality**, and exploring the world in order to learn and acquire information." -[MIT Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/17/66372/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/)
2. "If you have a good **causal model of the world** you are dealing with, you can generalize even in unfamiliar situations. That’s crucial. We humans are able to project ourselves into situations that are very different from our day-to-day experience. Machines are not, because they don’t have these causal models." - [MIT Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/17/66372/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/)

I believe that today’s machine-learning and AI tools won’t be enough to bring about real AI. “It’s not just going to be data-rich deep learning,” she says. Li believes AI researchers will need to think about things like emotional and social intelligence. - 

*  ****[**Gary Marcus**](http://garymarcus.com/index.html) **\(**Scientist, Author, Entrepreneur**\)**

"In particular, we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets — often using an approach known as deep learning — and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space and causality"
