# Leaders in the Industry

1. **Yoshua Bengio \(**A ****co-recipient of the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award for his work in deep learning**\):** 

* "I think we need to consider the hard challenges of AI and not be satisfied with short-term, incremental advances. I’m not saying I want to forget deep learning. On the contrary, I want to build on it. But we need to be able to extend it to do things like reasoning, **learning causality**, and exploring the world in order to learn and acquire information." -[MIT Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/17/66372/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/)
* "If you have a good **causal model of the world** you are dealing with, you can generalize even in unfamiliar situations. That’s crucial. We humans are able to project ourselves into situations that are very different from our day-to-day experience. Machines are not, because they don’t have these causal models." - [MIT Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/17/66372/one-of-the-fathers-of-ai-is-worried-about-its-future/)

2. Judea Pearl \(Awarded with the Turing Award in 2011\)
