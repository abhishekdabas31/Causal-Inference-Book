# Why we need Causality

Causality has made tremendous progress in past 30 years. 

**The Reasons why causality is needed are:**

1. Knowing and asking "**why**" is really important, Causality can answer these questions
2. Knowing about spurious correlations
3. Separating correlations from causation
4. Knowing the confounders in the data
5. **If we need more data or not?** It helps us in knowing if we can calculate the causal relationships from the data, or if we need more variables within our data for proper estimation.
6. Helps us understanding the Data Generating Process\(DGP\), which then leads us to ask more relevant questions \(Diagramatic representation of data is very important and helpful\)
7. Graphical approach in Causal Inference is more clear in respect to showcasing the objectives, assumptions and conditions
8. Causal inference can lead to better results for decision making compared to just statistical inference
9. Helps in making business decisions by understanding the data driving the model and making effective strategies by understanding the impact of key features.
10. Helps us understand that appropriate data is necessary. Even after having infinite data, we might miss important confounders, which hence can introduce bias in the model
11. Importance of Domain knowledge, which come into use in formalizing causal structure
12. Importance of human intervention, in this case assumptions
13. It can help companies build better products by effective decision making - Uber
